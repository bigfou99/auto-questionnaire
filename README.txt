# README for using the JavaScript function

To use the JavaScript function provided, follow the steps below:

1. Open the questionnaire in your web browser.

2. Open the console in your web browser.

   - For Chrome and Firefox, press `Ctrl + Shift + J` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Option + J` on Mac.

   - For Safari, go to `Preferences` > `Advanced` and check `Show Develop menu in menu bar`. Then, press `Option + Cmd + C`.

3. Copy and paste the JavaScript code from the 'auto_questionnaire.js'** file into the console.

   - To open 'auto_questionnaire.js', right click file and select edit.

4. Press `Enter`.

5. Fill out the questionnaire as usual.

   - Note that pressing the `Enter` key will automatically focus on the next question in the questionnaire.

   - The function is designed to work with radio buttons and checkboxes.

   - The function prevents the default behavior of the `Enter` key, so pressing `Enter` will not submit the form.

   - If the last question is reached, the `Enter` key will focus on the first question in the questionnaire.

   - You can use the left and right arrow keys to change the selection of the radio button.

6. Submit the questionnaire when finished.
